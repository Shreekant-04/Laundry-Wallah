## Overview

This project is a web-based service booking platform designed to facilitate the booking of various services. Users can add services to a cart, manage the cart, and place orders through a simple and intuitive interface. The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and responsive user experience.

## Features

### Navigation
- **Sticky Navigation Bar**: The navigation bar remains fixed at the top of the page for easy access.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: The HTML is configured to ensure smooth scrolling behavior for a better user experience.

### Main Interface
- **Hero Section**: Features an animated image to capture user attention.
- **Quotes Section**: Displays inspirational quotes related to the services.

### Services Section
- **Service Listing**: A comprehensive list of services available for booking.
- **Add to Cart Functionality**: Users can add services to their cart.
- **Remove from Cart Functionality**: Users can remove services from their cart.
- **Cart Management**: The cart dynamically updates with the services added or removed by the user.

### Cart
- **Cart Summary**: Displays the total number of items and the total price.
- **Background Change**: The background image of the cart changes based on whether it contains items.
- **Button Opacity**: The 'Book Now' button's opacity changes based on the cart's content.

### Booking Form
- **Order Submission**: Users can fill out a form and submit their order.
- **Form Validation**: Ensures that users cannot place an order without filling out the required form fields.

### Pop-up Notifications
- **Error Pop-ups**: Notify users when they try to place an order without adding items to the cart or filling out the form.
- **Order Confirmation**: Displays a confirmation message upon successful order placement.

## Detailed Components

- **Layout**: Defines the structure and layout of the navigation bar, main sections, and forms.
